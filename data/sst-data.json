Ichthyosaurs had a higher chance of being preserved than did <span class=\"keyword\">terrestrial</span> extraterrestrial <span class=\"keyword\">creatures</span> because, as marine animals, they tended to live in environments less subject to erosion. Still, their fossilization required a suite of factors: a slow rate of decay of soft tissues, little scavenging by other animals, a lack of swift currents and waves to jumble and carry away small bones, and fairly rapid burial. Given these factors, some areas have become a treasury of well-preserved ichthyosaur fossils.\r\nThe deposits at Holzmaden, Germany, present an interesting case for analysis. The ichthyosaur remains are found in black, bituminous marine shales deposited about 190 million years ago. Over the years, thousands of specimens of marine reptiles, fish and invertebrates have been recovered from these rocks. The quality of <span class=\"keyword\">preservation</span> is outstanding, but what is even more impressive is the number of ichthyosaur fossils containing preserved <span class=\"keyword\">embryos.</span> Ichthyosaurs with <span class=\"keyword\">embryos</span> have been reported from 6 different levels of the shale in a small area around Holzmaden, suggesting that a specific site was used by large numbers of <span class=\"keyword\">ichthyosaurs</span> repeatedly over time.

Considered reactionary on some issues, such as granting independence to Britain's colonies and at times regarded as a self--promoter who changed political parties to further his career, it was his wartime leadership that earned him iconic status. Some of his peacetime decisions, such as restoring the Gold Standard in 1924, were disastrous as was his World War I decided to land troops on the Dardanelles. However, during 1940, when Britain alone opposed Hitler's Nazi Germany in the free <span class=\"keyword\">world,</span> his stirring speeches inspired, motivated, and uplifted a whole people during their darkest hour. Churchill saw himself as a champion of democracy against tyranny and was profoundly aware of his own role and destiny. Indeed, he believed that God had placed him on earth to carry out heroic deeds for the protection of Christian civilization and human progress. A providential understanding of history would concur with Churchill's self--understanding. Considered old--fashioned, even reactionary by some people today, he was actually a visionary whose dream was of a united <span class=\"keyword\">world,</span> beginning with a union of the English--speaking peoples, then embracing all cultures. In his youth, he cut a dashing figure as a cavalry officer as seen in the <span class=\"keyword\">1972</span> <span class=\"keyword\">film</span> Young Winston (directed by Richard Attenborough), but the images of him that are the most widely remembered are as a rather <span class=\"keyword\">overweight,</span> determined, even pugnacious looking <span class=\"keyword\">senior</span> <span class=\"keyword\">statesman</span> as he is depicted to the right.\r\n"},{"keywords":"19th century pattern books houses afford hire architect invaluable resource historians","id":"6651","audio":"https://ptefilesbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test_question/0/613b077594069.mp3","description":"In today’s class we’ll be examining some nineteenth-century <span class=\"keyword\">pattern</span> <span class=\"keyword\">books</span> that were used for building <span class=\"keyword\">houses.</span> I think it’s fair to say that these <span class=\"keyword\">pattern</span> <span class=\"keyword\">books</span> were the most important influence on the design of North American <span class=\"keyword\">houses</span> during the nineteenth <span class=\"keyword\">century.</span> This was because most people who wanted to build a house couldn’t <span class=\"keyword\">afford</span> to <span class=\"keyword\">hire</span> an <span class=\"keyword\">architect.</span> Instead, they bought a <span class=\"keyword\">pattern</span> book, picked out a plan, and took it to the builder.

It was written in French although it’s heavily peppered with Anglicanism, suggesting that the book was written in English initially and later translated to French. The 15th-century copy of the work says it was originally written in Latin, translated into French, and then translated into English that it might reach men of all parts of the world but this seems to be a much later edition.

I think this is something I would really like to discuss because it is not necessarily very well understood is that I think museums, as Dave insisted by putting up my quote in his slide, create a very particular kind of <span class=\"keyword\">history.</span> It’s not the kind of <span class=\"keyword\">history</span> that gets created in books or in dating films or in compositions, it’s a very particular kind of <span class=\"keyword\">history</span> that grows out of the fact that museums are centrally interested and defined by their collections.

Curators try to understand <span class=\"keyword\">material</span> culture as evidence of other people’s lives as a means to try to understand other people - what they look like, what they did, how they made a living, what they hoped for in their lives, how they tried to construct their world and why they made particular choices.

If you go through university <span class=\"keyword\">history</span> primarily you are encouraged to draw on things like archival accounts, manuscripts and now oral histories, and most of that work is actually promulgated in the form of books. There are also other kinds of <span class=\"keyword\">historians.</span> Obviously, filmmakers and photographers concentrate on creating images of the world and arranging them in meaningful sequences, but curators attend to <span class=\"keyword\">objects.</span> We look at <span class=\"keyword\">objects</span> as evidence of the <span class=\"keyword\">past</span> and try to arrange <span class=\"keyword\">objects</span> in meaningful ways called exhibitions."},{"keywords":"fault relationship earthquake model surface epicenter rupture seismic map plane waves","id":"3296","audio":"https://ptefilesbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test_question/0/5e05757fd256b.mp3","description":"So we have a float <span class=\"keyword\">plane,</span> and then the <span class=\"keyword\">earthquake</span> itself occurred on this boat <span class=\"keyword\">plane,</span> the <span class=\"keyword\">earthquake</span> starts that particular point on the <span class=\"keyword\">fault</span> <span class=\"keyword\">plane.</span> And we call that the focus of the <span class=\"keyword\">earthquake.</span> And then the <span class=\"keyword\">rupture</span> propagates out from that point on the on the <span class=\"keyword\">rupture</span> <span class=\"keyword\">plane</span> to cover the entire full <span class=\"keyword\">plane.</span> That ruptures in that particular <span class=\"keyword\">earthquake.</span> We talked about the <span class=\"keyword\">epicenter</span> of an <span class=\"keyword\">earthquake</span> a lot, the <span class=\"keyword\">epicenter</span> is just the <span class=\"keyword\">surface</span> projection of the focus of the <span class=\"keyword\">earthquake.</span> So if we wanted to look in <span class=\"keyword\">map</span> view at where the <span class=\"keyword\">earthquake</span> was located, and we were able to look down into the earth, we would see the focus down at some depth near or the <span class=\"keyword\">epicenter</span> is just the point vertically above that focus at the <span class=\"keyword\">surface</span> of the earth.

I should stress, though, that <span class=\"keyword\">immigration</span> during that period went in both directions. In fact, the flow of people and goods went completely unhindered. There wasn't even a border post until around 1850. The people of the time saw Maine and Quebec as a single region, mainly because of the strong French <span class=\"keyword\">influence,</span> which is still evident in Maine today. Eventually, the <span class=\"keyword\">road</span> fell into disuse as a major railway was completed; finally, people simply forgot about it and that's how it came to be lost.

(The pictures were taken when the <span class=\"keyword\">mother</span> was not present.) The pictures spanned a wide range of human emotion and included images of the <span class=\"keyword\">child</span> making <span class=\"keyword\">happy,</span> <span class=\"keyword\">sad</span> or neutral faces. These pictures were then matched with images of an unknown infant. The central finding was that seeing the <span class=\"keyword\">happy</span> face of the mother’s own infant <span class=\"keyword\">activated</span> all of the key areas in the <span class=\"keyword\">brain</span> associated with <span class=\"keyword\">reward</span> processing. These regions include the ventral tegumental area, substantial Nigeria and the striatum. This finding suggests that for mothers the sight of their smiling baby is a potent <span class=\"keyword\">reward</span> and represents a uniquely pleasurable experience. Furthermore, this neural response was graded, so that <span class=\"keyword\">happy</span> faces led to more activation than neutral faces. Sad faces generated the <span class=\"keyword\">least</span> activation. In other words, the response of mothers in their <span class=\"keyword\">reward</span> areas seemed to directly mirror the emotions the infant displayed."},{"keywords":"bumblebees flowers color warmer cooler quality quantity nectar","id":"3301","audio":"https://ptefilesbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test_question/0/5d6b71aedd1d2.mp3","description":"Why the <span class=\"keyword\">bumblebees</span> pick some <span class=\"keyword\">flowers</span> over others?

So if one flower is <span class=\"keyword\">warmer</span> than another, a bee can save some of its fuel by basking on that flower while it’s doing its pollinating business.

It’s Megan this week I’m going to talk about the <span class=\"keyword\">difference</span> between <span class=\"keyword\">translators</span> and <span class=\"keyword\">interpreters.</span> It’s a common <span class=\"keyword\">misconception</span> that <span class=\"keyword\">translators</span> and <span class=\"keyword\">interpreters</span> di the same thing. So I just like to highlight a few similarities and differences between the two… firstly translation refers to <span class=\"keyword\">written</span> <span class=\"keyword\">communication</span> whereas interpreting refers to <span class=\"keyword\">verbal</span> <span class=\"keyword\">communication.</span> So for example a translator will not attend a court hearing to verbally translate between the parties involved but would translate the <span class=\"keyword\">written</span> evidence used in the case. Secondly both jobs require different skills and translate to require the ability to write well and comprehensively into a target language. This means that they need to have an excellent command of their native language. For example although I can speak French to a good standard I cannot translate from English to French. Although I could translate from French into English. Which means I’m only halfway there to being an international player. An interpreter needs to be able to speak both languages proficiently. Thirdly the qualifications and experience required to become either a professional translator or interpreter do differ. Both roles acquire years of training the resulting qualification. But what they can learn on the training will be completely different. So just to be clear <span class=\"keyword\">translators</span> will translate <span class=\"keyword\">written</span> texts and <span class=\"keyword\">interpreters</span> will translate a <span class=\"keyword\">verbal</span> <span class=\"keyword\">communication.</span>"},{"keywords":"career good prospects service sectors job market competitive qualifications technical degree courses wage","id":"1770","audio":"https://ptefilesbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test_question/0/5bb19260d4487.m4a","description":"Start a <span class=\"keyword\">career</span> with <span class=\"keyword\">good</span> <span class=\"keyword\">prospects,</span> <span class=\"keyword\">service</span> sector, <span class=\"keyword\">job</span> <span class=\"keyword\">market</span> is <span class=\"keyword\">competitive,</span> <span class=\"keyword\">qualifications,</span> <span class=\"keyword\">technical</span> <span class=\"keyword\">courses,</span> <span class=\"keyword\">degree</span> <span class=\"keyword\">courses,</span> make them employable, offer a living <span class=\"keyword\">wage,</span> require a <span class=\"keyword\">degree.</span> "},{"keywords":"voynich manuscript theories hoax secrets decode language","id":"3306","audio":"https://ptefilesbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test_question/0/5d6b75654b671.mp3","description":"Well, the Voynich <span class=\"keyword\">manuscript</span> does have many different <span class=\"keyword\">theories</span> proposed for it .

What is <span class=\"keyword\">incivility?</span> It's <span class=\"keyword\">disrespect</span> or rudeness. It includes a lot of different behaviors, from mocking or belittling someone to teasing people in ways that sting to telling offensive jokes to texting in meetings. And what's uncivil to one person may be absolutely fine to another. Take texting while someone's speaking to you. Some of us may find it rude, others may think it's absolutely civil. So it really <span class=\"keyword\">depends.</span> It's all in the <span class=\"keyword\">eyes</span> of the <span class=\"keyword\">beholder</span> and whether that person felt disrespected. We may not mean to make someone feel that way, but when we do, it has consequences. Over 22 years ago, I vividly recall walking into this stuffy hospital room. It was heartbreaking to see my dad, this strong, athletic, energetic guy, lying in the bed with electrodes strapped to his bare chest.What put him there was work-related stress. For over a decade, he suffered an uncivil boss. And for me, I thought he was just an outlier at that time"},{"keywords":"leadership impact lives money power fear powerful capable redefines","id":"1790","audio":"https://ptefilesbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test_question/0/5bbda0012f237.m4a","description":"It's scary to think of ourselves as that <span class=\"keyword\">powerful,</span> frightening to think we can matter that much to other people. As long as we make <span class=\"keyword\">leadership</span> something bigger than us, as long as we keep <span class=\"keyword\">leadership</span> beyond us and make it about changing the world, we give ourselves an excuse not to expect it every day, from ourselves and from each other. Marianne Williamson said, \"Our greatest <span class=\"keyword\">fear</span> is not that we are inadequate. [It] is that we are <span class=\"keyword\">powerful</span> beyond measure. It is our light and not our darkness that frightens us.\" My call to action today is that we need to get over our <span class=\"keyword\">fear</span> of how extraordinarily <span class=\"keyword\">powerful</span> we can be in each other's <span class=\"keyword\">lives.</span> We need to get over it so we can move beyond it, and our little brothers and sisters and one day our kids -- or our kids right now -- can watch and start to value the <span class=\"keyword\">impact</span> we can have on each other's <span class=\"keyword\">lives,</span> more than <span class=\"keyword\">money</span> and <span class=\"keyword\">power</span> and titles and influence. We need to redefine <span class=\"keyword\">leadership</span> as being about lollipop moments -- how many of them we create, how many we acknowledge, how many of them we pay forward and how many we say thank you for. Because we've made <span class=\"keyword\">leadership</span> about changing the world, and there is no world. There's only six billion understandings of it. And if you change one person's understanding of it, understanding of what they're <span class=\"keyword\">capable</span> of,understanding of how much people care about them, understanding of how <span class=\"keyword\">powerful</span> an agent for change they can be in this world, you've changed the whole thing. And if we can understand <span class=\"keyword\">leadership</span> like that, I think if we can redefine <span class=\"keyword\">leadership</span> like that, I think we can change everything. And it's a simple idea, but I don't think it's a small one."},{"keywords":"leah female wife child male 50 age medicallly transition help","id":"1791","audio":"https://ptefilesbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test_question/0/5bbda0887373d.m4a","description":"Now let me tell you about Leah. I had the pleasure of meeting Leah a few years back. She's a <span class=\"keyword\">female</span> and she has a <span class=\"keyword\">wife</span> and a <span class=\"keyword\">child.</span> See, Leah was also assigned <span class=\"keyword\">male</span> at birth and she knew since she was a young <span class=\"keyword\">child</span> that she was not a <span class=\"keyword\">male,</span> that she was a <span class=\"keyword\">female.</span> She hid it from herself and from everyone she knew, especially from her <span class=\"keyword\">wife,</span> until the <span class=\"keyword\">age</span> of <span class=\"keyword\">50.</span> She couldn't take it anymore. She was like, I can't keep living like this. I gotta get honest. She was extremely scared to tell her <span class=\"keyword\">wife.</span> What if her <span class=\"keyword\">wife</span> said, \"This is unacceptable, I want a divorce, get out\"? To her surprise, her <span class=\"keyword\">wife</span> was accepting. She said, \"I love you regardless of who you are. I want to <span class=\"keyword\">help</span> you in every way I can.\" So she talked with her <span class=\"keyword\">wife,</span> and she made the decision that she wanted to medically <span class=\"keyword\">transition,</span> and she was interested in being assessed for hormone replacement therapy, otherwise known as HRT. So she made an appointment with her doctor. She arrived on the day of her appointment early. She filled out all the paperwork, put the name correctly down there and waited patiently. A little bit of time passed and a nurse called her back to the exam room. When she got back there, she took a deep breath, and the doctor and the nurse walked in. She extended her hand to the doctor and said, \"Hi, I'm Leah.\" The doctor looked at her, didn't shake her hand and said, \"Why are you here?\""}]
